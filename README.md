# Date Night In
Date Night In is a web application that pairs movies and recipes according to the user's chosen mood.

## Usage

The user first chooses their mood. A carousel of movie posters appears and flippable recipe cards fill in underneath.

The user can then hover over each recipe card and browse over the ingredient list. 

The movies are randomized, so that user will not get the same list for each mood. 

## Technology Used

HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, AJAx, Swiper.js, Bootstrap3, Edamam API, and TMDB API 

## Future Updates

- Include additional recipes for randomized recipe cards

- Add list of streaming services to movie posters

- Add full user authentication
  
- Give users the ability to save favorite recipes.

- Give users the ability to share their list of favorites to social media
